Introduction to Algorithms
What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a step-by-step process to solve a problem. It is like a recipe that provides clear instructions to achieve a goal.

Why Are Algorithms Important?
Efficiency: Helps computers solve problems quickly and correctly.
Optimization: Finds the best way to perform a task with minimal resources.
Scalability: Can handle large amounts of data effectively.
Foundation of Programming: Every software or application relies on well-designed algorithms.
Types of Problems Solved by Algorithms

1. Searching Problems
These problems involve finding an item in a collection of data.
Example: Looking up a contact in a phonebook.

Algorithms:
Linear Search (O(n)) – Checks each item one by one.
Binary Search (O(log n)) – Efficiently finds an item in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the list.

2. Sorting Problems
These problems involve arranging data in a specific order.
Example: Sorting a list of students by their marks.

Algorithms:
Bubble Sort (O(n²)) – Compares and swaps adjacent elements.
Merge Sort (O(n log n)) – Divides the list into halves, sorts, and merges them.
Quick Sort (O(n log n)) – Picks a pivot and partitions elements around it.

3. Mathematical Problems
These problems involve calculations and numerical operations.
Example: Finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

Algorithms:
Euclidean Algorithm (O(log n)) – A fast method for computing GCD.
Sieve of Eratosthenes (O(n log log n)) – Efficiently finds prime numbers up to a given number.

4. Graph Problems
Graph algorithms solve problems related to networks and connections.
Example: Finding the shortest path between two cities.

Algorithms:
Dijkstra’s Algorithm (O(V²) or O(E log V)) – Finds the shortest path in a graph.
Breadth-First Search (BFS) (O(V + E)) – Explores all nodes level by level.
Depth-First Search (DFS) (O(V + E)) – Explores a path deeply before backtracking.

5. Dynamic Programming Problems
These problems can be broken down into smaller overlapping subproblems.
Example: Computing Fibonacci numbers efficiently.

Algorithms:
Memoization (Top-Down Approach) – Stores previously computed values to avoid redundant calculations.
Tabulation (Bottom-Up Approach) – Builds solutions iteratively from base cases.

6. String Processing Problems
These problems involve working with text data.
Example: Checking if a word exists in a document.

Algorithms:
Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm (O(n)) – Searches for a substring efficiently.
Rabin-Karp Algorithm (O(n)) – Uses hashing for fast string matching.

7. Greedy Algorithm Problems
These problems are solved by making the best choice at each step without reconsidering previous steps.
Example: Finding the minimum number of coins for a given amount.

Algorithms:
Huffman Coding – Compresses files efficiently.
Prim’s Algorithm – Finds the minimum spanning tree of a graph.
